## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Upnote - is one of my favorite apps because its full of useful features and highly customizable.  What would make the app even better is if text wrapping was an option (without having to resize the window on a computer) and if there was a webapp available.
2. Gmail - is another favorite app because of its speed and ease of use.  A couple suggestions would be to improve the filtering of emails to spam and promotions folders and to fix the issue of links becoming unclickable once they are filtered to spam.
3. Brightwheel - is another favorite app because of the payments feature and ease of use.  Improvements would be to allow parents to send picture messages and documents to teachers.  There should also be an option to check out children if the app malfunctions (perhaps by an email passcode or text message option)

App Idea:  SCMV Connect - the purpose of this app is to connect potential clients to highly qualified attorneys to address their legal needs.  It will go through a series of questions to screen the client and direct them to the closest match for the practice area and allow them to choose to connect with an attorney on demand.
